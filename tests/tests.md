## Test Files

### `app_test.go`

- **Purpose**: This test file contains unit tests for the application logic in the `app` package. It tests various aspects of the application, including initialization and core functionality.

### `database_test.go`

- **Purpose**: This test file contains unit tests for the database-related functionality in the `app` package. It tests database initialization, schema setup, and other database interactions.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use the `go test` command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
go test ./tests
```

The command will discover and execute all test functions defined in the test files. It's a crucial part of ensuring that the application functions correctly and maintains its integrity as it evolves.
