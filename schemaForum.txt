### This structure represents the organization of your Go web application:
  - main.go contains the main application entry point.
  - handlers directory contains handler functions for different routes.
  - sessions directory contains code for managing user sessions.
  - models directory contains data models, such as the User struct.
  - utils directory contains utility functions, such as password hashing.
  - templates directory contains HTML templates for your web pages.

You can create these directories and files in your project to organize your code accordingly. This structure separates different parts of your application for better maintainability and organization.
